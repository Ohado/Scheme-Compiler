# Scheme-Compiler

A functional programming compiler that translates Scheme code into Assembly language. This project is built using **OCaml** and demonstrates the power of functional programming in compiler construction.

## Features

- **Scheme to Assembly translation**: The compiler converts Scheme code into low-level Assembly instructions.
- **Written in OCaml**: Leveraging OCamlâ€™s functional programming capabilities for building the compiler.
- **Optimized**: Implements basic optimizations for generated Assembly code.
- **Scheme syntax support**: Supports a subset of Scheme language features for translation.

## Technologies Used

- **OCaml**: A functional programming language used for writing the compiler.
- **Assembly**: The output target of the compiler.
- **Functional Programming Concepts**: Demonstrating concepts such as immutability, recursion, and higher-order functions in OCaml.
